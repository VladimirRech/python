Public repository to share my journey into python language.

In this moment, I'm trying to learn a new language just for fun, and this repository will share my journey into Python.

My goals are:

1. Learn from the beginning.
2. The basics: environment setup, basic sintax, loops, basic resources.
3. File manipulation
4. Define next topics
